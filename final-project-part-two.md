# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

Since I've change the topic from Final project I (about fertility rate) to Final project II (New Year's Resolution), I've drafted a new storyboard.
I've structred the narrative around the key stages of New Year's resolutions. 
The opening will introduce the common perception of "New Year's resolution most likely failed", followed by a research paper showing that percentage of people making resolution succeed more than the one that doesn't. This visualization will just be paragraph with picture on the side. <br>

Next, I plan to include a participation chart showing how many Americans made New Year's Resolutions in 2024: using Human Icon percentage chart. </br> 
Then from those who made the resolutions, will be broken down by age group: using Bar chart. <br>
Then I'll move on to dot plot of NY's resolution category by each age group to see which category each age focusing on. <br> 

A follow-up section will extend this analysis globally, using a regional and gender breakdown from the 2025 statistics report by Table chart and highlight some of the most common categories among the region. <br>

To show the challenges, I plan to adapt a survival-curve style bar or line chart that illustrates how long resolutions last. <br>

Finally, I’ll close with a visual summary that combines data on why resolutions fail with strategies that help people succeed (approach goals, moderate support, small measurable habits).

So in Shorthand draft, I will be organized as a scrolling story arc: 
1. hook (Title)
2. Americans participation
3. American resolution categories
4. Global regional categories comparison
5. Duration (how long does resolutions last)
6. Reasons why fail and what help
7. Key takeaway.

Each storyboard panel is designed to walk the reader through one part of this narrative, supported by charts built in Tableau, Datawrapper or PowerPoint and Excel (if needed).

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

Text here!

The primary audience I hope to reach might be broad but more specific to the reader who are interested in self-improvment and habit formation, particularly young adults who more likely to make New Year's resolutions that other age group. I also want to resonate with older adults to show them that it is possible to succeed in New Year's resolution by starting making one. <br>

In this project I've 4 age groups (18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65+) so I will try to find people who are in those age groups how they think about these New Year's resolutions so I can compare them. <br>

This mixed group will allow me to test whether my visuals are clear and engaging for them. The feedback will guide me in refining my visualization so that the final story communicates effectively across a broad audience. <br>

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

Text here!

The goal of the interviews is to understand how my draft visualizations and narratives are perceived by the interviewer. I want to identify what works, what didn't work, is there any questions or confusion, any other information they would want to know.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Assess clarity of visualizations | When you look at the specific chart, what do you think I'm trying to show? |
| Measure engagement and relatability | Does this story feel relevant to you? have you done it before and what are the results? |
| Identify improvement opportunities | What part of the visualization was confusing or any information you would like to know further? |

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

Text here!

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the visualization clear and understandable? | It's easy to understand and follow  | I liked it | Agreed with Interview 1 |
| Do you feel related to these New Year's categories   | For sure, especially health and well being. Also, saving more money most likely be a weekly plan not even yearly plan | Agreed with Interview 1  | I think money is really important topic for New Year's resolution |
| Any comment or suggestions? | Does the failing rate is from USA or globally data? | More clear on what percentage you put on the failing rate | Yeah, I want to know how many percent people acutally success in those resolutions? |


# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  

Text here!
Based on the three interviewers, they found that the visualizations generally clear and relatable, especially around health and financial categories. However, they also raised specific questions about the scope of the data and wanted more clarity around resolution success and failure rates. To address this, I will refine my visuals to emphasize transparency and ensure clear labeling. <br>

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findings or observations from interviews | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. |
| Visualizations are clear and easy to follow, but still need better context. | Keep current chart formats, but add brief captions explaining what each chart represents. |
| Participants wanted clarification about whether failure rates are U.S.-only or global. | Add a note to specify the geographic scope of each dataset (U.S. vs global).|
| One interviewer want to see more details about the failing/sucess rate percentages.|Refine failing-rate visualization by adding clearer axis labels and a breakdown of percentage values or add another chart showing percentage of people who succeed/fail in resolutions. |
|Financial resolutions stood out as highly important across participants. | Reorder story so that health-related and money/finances is highlighted resolutions.|

> ...include any final thoughts you have here.

The interviewers think that the topic engaging and relevant, especially health and finance-related resolutions. For Part III, I will focus on clarifying data sources, adding annotations, and including both failure and success perspectives to strengthen the story’s credibility and relatability. <br>
