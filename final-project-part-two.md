# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

Since I've change the topic from Final project I (about fertility rate) to Final project II (New Year's Resolution), I've drafted a new storyboard.
I've structred the narrative around the key stages of New Year's resolutions. 
The opening will introduce the common perception of "New Year's resolution most likely failed", followed by a research paper showing that percentage of people making resolution succeed more than the one that doesn't. This visualization will just be paragraph with picture on the side. </br>

Next, I plan to include a participation chart showing how many Americans made New Year's Resolutions in 2024: using Human Icon percentage chart. </br> 
Then from those who made the resolutions, will be broken down by age group: using Bar chart. </br>
Then I'll move on to dot plot of NY's resolution category by each age group to see which category each age focusing on. </br> 

A follow-up section will extend this analysis globally, using a regional and gender breakdown from the 2025 statistics report by Table chart and highlight some of the most common categories among the region. </br>

To show the challenges, I plan to adapt a survival-curve style bar or line chart that illustrates how long resolutions last. </br>

Finally, Iâ€™ll close with a visual summary that combines data on why resolutions fail with strategies that help people succeed (approach goals, moderate support, small measurable habits).

So in Shorthand draft, I will be organized as a scrolling story arc: 
1. hook (Title)
2. Americans participation
3. American resolution categories
4. Global regional categories comparison
5. Duration (how long does resolutions last)
6. Reasons why fail and what help
7. Key takeaway.

Each storyboard panel is designed to walk the reader through one part of this narrative, supported by charts built in Tableau, Datawrapper or PowerPoint and Excel (if needed).

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

The primary audience I hope to reach might be broad but more specific to the reader who are interested in self-improvment and habit formation, particularly young adults who more likely to make New Year's resolutions that other age group. I also want to resonate with older adults to show them that it is possible to succeed in New Year's resolution by starting making one. </br>

In this project I've 4 age groups (18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65+) so I will try to find people who are in those age groups how they think about these New Year's resolutions so I can compare them. </br>

This mixed group will allow me to test whether my visuals are clear and engaging for them. The feedback will guide me in refining my visualization so that the final story communicates effectively across a broad audience. </br>

| What category you made for New Year's resolution?  | Obviously about health  |  Majority focus health rather than losing weight | Agreed with Interview 1 |
| Do you think saving more money is one of the important New Yea'rs resolution | For sure, it most likely be a weekly plan not even yearly plan |    Agreed with Interview 1  | I think money is really important topic for New Year's resolution |
| Do you think how long of New Year's resolution last? | I was just going to ask, because I think it even less than a month |  I'm not sure | Yeah, I want to know how many percent people acutally success in those resolutions? |
