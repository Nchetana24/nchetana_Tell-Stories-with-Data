_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

The original data visualization topic is "The 20 Largest Solar Power Plants in the World" with reference link below:
https://solarpower.guide/solar-energy-insights/largest-solar-plants

I selected this visualization because I'm interested in global warming issues and how the world is transitioning toward cleaner energy by adopting solar power plants instead of conventional power sources. I'm also curious about which countries are leading in clean energy development, their production capacity, and the efficiency levels they achieve.
While the visualization on the website is colorful and eye-catching, it's also difficult to interpret and lacks comprehensive information. Therefore, I believe I can create a simplified version of the chart that would be more useful and accessible to the audience.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

I've critiqued this data visualization based on Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile as followed: <br>
1.Usefulness (Score: 7/10) <br>
2. Completeness (Score: 6/10) <br>
3. Perceptibility (Score: 3/10) <br>
4. Truthfulness (Score: 7/10) <br>
5. Intuitiveness (Score: 7/10) <br>
6. Aesthetics (Score: 8/10) <br>
7. Engagement (Score: 9/10) <br>

When I first looked at the visualization of the largest solar plants, the bold, colorful, and aesthetically appealing infographic style immediately caught my attention. <br>
### What worked well: 
- The large bars and circles effectively communicated that we were comparing the scale of each solar facility across multiple dimensions (timeline, area, and capacity). <br>
- The design successfully draws the eye and make the chart visually engaging and attention-grabbing.
### What didn't work well: 
Once I moved beyond the initial impression, several issues became clear that the visualization made it difficult to compare plants precisely. Because: <br>
- Difficult to read: The bar charts and area indicators were densely packed and hard to read, forcing viewers to trace their eyes from the area chart (resembling a pie chart) across indicator lines to match corresponding capacity bar charts. <br>
- Scale inconsistencies: The capacity bar charts, and timeline bubble sizes were difficult to compare accurately. I had to rely on labels for exact capacity numbers since visual estimation was nearly impossible. For example, when comparing facilities with capacities of 550MWp versus 2,245MWp, the bar height difference didn't appear to reflect the actual 4x difference.<br>
- Unclear visual elements: Each bar contained color gradients (darker and lighter sections) without any legend or explanation of their significance which creates confusion about what additional information they might represent.<br>
- Inconsistent data presentation: The timeline displayed only selected facilities while the area and capacity charts included many more countries, creating gaps in the comparative analysis.<br>
- Additional: The visualization doesn't show which country has the largest overall solar capacity or how each facility's size relates to energy consumption in its respective country or region.<br>

For all these reasons, I think the primary audience seems to be the general public, i.e., people who are interested in renewable energy since this is a popular topic. In that sense, the visualization is partially effective because it grabs viewers' attention with its visually appealing graphics.
However, I don't think it fully serves a more informed audience such as analysts or energy professionals since the visualization doesn't provide enough context or insights. Instead, they have to read additional context on the website to obtain more information.<br>

## Step three: Sketch a solution
At first, I aim to redesin the visualization by focusing on enhancing comparability and providing additional context.<br>
1. For the timeline component, I will replace the bubble chart with a format that enables clearer differentiation, likely implementing a ranked horizontal bar chart that organizes plants by their capacity in megawatts.<br>
2. For capacity and area visualization, I will retain the bar chart format but ensure accurate scaling and proportional representation.<br>
3. Additionally, I plan to incorporate information showing which country leads in solar power capacity and include per capita comparisons.<br>
I’m excited to try a many charts type that will balances clarity, insight, and storytelling in a way the original design didn’t achieve but still remain attention grabbing appealing.<br>

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
