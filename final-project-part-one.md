# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.
 
Global fertility has fallen dramatically from large families 1950 to around two children per woman today. My project visualizes that decline with a focus on how the pattern varies by region and what the next decades might look like under UN projections. Rather than centering any single country, I stay at the regional and global levels so the class can engage with the big picture without singling out classmates’ home countries.

Beyond showing the trend, I want to help a general audience understand why fertility fell (education, urbanization, child survival, costs, norms) and what it means (aging populations, shrinking workforces, policy responses). The story is descriptive and explanatory—grounded in UN and Our World in Data series and ends with a brief evidence-based discussion of levers countries use to adapt.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

Story Arc
1. Start with What's Happening with Fertility rate around the world?
   World fertility map (2025): use diverging color palette centered at 2.24 to make the below/above global replacement fertility divide instantly
   clear. Also stating that - Most of Africa remains above replacement; Europe/East Asia are below.
2. How did we get here?
   Show the Slope plot of fertility rate from 1950 -> 2025 and projected fertility rate from 2025 -> 2100 to show that every region has declined,
   but not at the same pace.
3. Why did it happen?
   Five concise drivers : women’s education/paid work, urbanization/costs, child survival & healthcare, contraception access, shifting norms/late
   marriage.
4. What next?
   Possible solution: Policy/Adaptation summary
   “What can help?” bullets: family supports (childcare, leave, cash), work–life flexibility and gender equity, selective immigration,
   productivity/automation, pension & healthcare reform.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

I use these data sources for fertility rate each year from 1950 to 2100 (projection) to make the visualization:
- Annual total fertility rate in each continent and worldwide from 1950 to 2023, with projections until 2050: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1034075/fertility-rate-world-continents-1950-2020/
- Total Fertility Rate of World: https://database.earth/population/world/fertility-rate
- List of countries by total fertility rate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_fertility_rate
  
I used the following sources to gather facts about fertility rates, enabling me to tell the story of how the decline in fertility rates occurred and explore possible solutions to address this issue.
- 5 facts about global fertility trends:  https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/15/5-facts-about-global-fertility-trends/
- The global decline of the fertility rate: https://ourworldindata.org/global-decline-fertility-rate

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
> In a few sentences, you should document how you plan on completing your final project. 

I plan to complete my final project by combining the fertility datasets with interactive visualizations built in Tableau and polished static charts produced in Python.
The workflow will include:
1. Collecting and cleaning fertility rate data by world region and year.
2. Designing each visualization (map, slope chart projections) to align with the story arc developed in my outline.
3. Annotating visuals with direct labels and short explanations for clarity.
4. Publishing the final interactive and static graphics on GitHub Pages, ensuring accessibility and proper citation.

This approach allows me to merge interactive exploration (via Tableau) with carefully designed explanatory graphics (via Python), creating a cohesive, data-driven story about global fertility decline.
